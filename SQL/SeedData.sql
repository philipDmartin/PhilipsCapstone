Less subtle and profound than its predecessor, its still an exciting and colourful action adventure. This time out, astronaut James Franciscus and chimpanzee scientist Kim Hunter search for Charlton Heston (star of the first film) in the nuclear-devastated future, evading militaristic apes only to stumble upon an underground community of mutant, telepathic humans. It ends somewhat hammily in the buried ruins of Grand Central Station, but the total destruction of the world didnt stop three more progressively silly sequels. In fact, the finale manages a startling impact considering the films tendency to wallow in the camper aspects of its taut material.', 'http://lorempixel.com/920/360/', '2019-12-04', 'Action', 3, 1);

A tumultuous two and a half-hour evocation of sex in the ’70s, this chunk of movie dynamite is detonated by Mark Wahlberg, the rapper formerly known as Marky Mark, who grabs a breakout role and runs with it. What sounds like a tacky peek into the inner workings of the porn industry in the late ’70s, when President Carter admitted to having lust in his heart, is like The Ice Storm, a film about family. Just don’t think Disney, since the teen busboy hero, Eddie Adams (Wahlberg), who is estranged from his parents, rises to X-rated fame on the size of his dick (Wahlberg wears a prosthetic device) and his apt new name, Dirk Diggler.', 'http://lorempixel.com/920/360/', '2019-12-04', 'Mystory', 1, 2);

This is the work of an artist so sublimely confident that he doesnt include a single shot simply to keep our attention. He reduces each scene to its essence, and leaves it on screen long enough for us to contemplate it, to inhabit it in our imaginations.

Their dialogue is witty and entertaining, and its also disarming, because it makes these two thugs seem all too normal. If you didnt know better, you might assume these were regular guys having chit-chat on their way to work. Other than the comic payoff at the end of the scene, in which they use parts of this conversation to taunt their victims, their talk has no relevance to anything in the film, or to anything else, for that matter. Yet without such scenes, "Pulp Fiction" wouldnt be "Pulp Fiction." I get the sense that Tarantino put into the film whatever struck his fancy, and somehow the final product is not only coherent but wonderfully textured.', 'http://lorempixel.com/920/360/', '2019-12-04', 'Mystory', 1, 4);

The easy answer is that his wife has made him jealous.

And writer-director Ari Aster has certainly done that with his “Hereditary” follow-up, “Midsommar.” Following a group of American grad students on a trip to a mysterious midnight sun festival in Sweden, Aster gives us a slow-burning, boldly-made meditation on grief and the disintegration of a relationship in the loose frame of a folk horror film, yet it struggles to break much new ground beneath its carnival of brightly lit grotesqueries.', 'http://lorempixel.com/920/360/', '2019-12-04', 'Mystory', 1, 4);
